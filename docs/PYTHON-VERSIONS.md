# Python Versions

Most work uses the latest Python version, which many already have installed.
Complex tools like Kafka and Spark Streaming often lag behind the latest version
as it takes a long time to update and test their code base.  
This course requires Python 3.11 for compatibility.

Youâ€™re encouraged to install both Python 3.11 and the latest version to practice managing multiple versions. 
If disk space is tight, installing just Python 3.11 is enough for this course.

## Managing Multiple Versions

Windows: The built-in Windows Python Launcher (py) simplifies managing multiple versions. 
This is why we use py instead of python or python3. 
And py allows us to specify which version to use (e.g., py -3.11).

Mac/Linux: Tools like pyenv help install and switch between Python versions easily.
